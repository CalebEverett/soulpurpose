From Takjikistan to Santa Ana, CA, Niko has taken pleasure and delight in holding mirrors up to others so they can see their own greatness.  Growing up with parents who were loving, but who struggled with addiction she created her own path to launching a non-profit, Girls For A Change, at the age of 25, showing young women around the world that they were unstoppable.  She was eventually named one of the “40 Under 40” up and comers in Silicon Valley, CA.  In 2010, she helped build Career College of California, a higher education model that empowers high school graduates to achieve their hopes, dreams and aspirations in life.

Niko has an unquenchable passion for making possibilities real.  She was a scholarship recipient at the Harvard Business School’s Non-Profit Management Program, was selected as a Diplomatic Speaker to Tajikisan by the US State Department and has raised millions of dollars to support her work empowering women and girls.

She now lives in Southern California with her husband and young son where she works for the Broad Academy supporting education leaders to transform America’s urban public schools so that every kid gets a world-class education.

In her free time she is writing an ebook designed to empower readers of all ages to see their own greatness, build their self-efficacy and improve their enjoyment and performance in life.
